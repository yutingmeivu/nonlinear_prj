# Comparision of performance of nonlinear optimization method used in accelerating multi neuron network

-----

### optimization method:
- steepest descent
- conjugate gradient
### line search method to find step size t:
- newton's method
- regula falsi
- secant method

(still have some bugs, see if I can fix itðŸ¥²)
